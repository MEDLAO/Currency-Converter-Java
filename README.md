This project is a simple currency converter implemented in Java. It uses the [Frankfurter API](https://www.frankfurter.app/) to fetch real-time exchange rates between supported currencies.  
The main objective of the project was to practice Java fundamentals such as loops, conditionals, user input handling, and API integration using HTTP requests.  
The project was developed using the Eclipse IDE.
